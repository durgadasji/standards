# Coordination Structural Integrity Suite

Distributed coordination is struggling to find solid footing. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and other coordination experiments have failed not because participants were malicious or incompetent, but because the systems lacked structural foundations. These standards specify those foundations.

This repository contains ten standards developed in the course of building the Proof of Coordination protocol: seven Tensegrity Compressive Standards and three Tensegrity Generative Standards. Together they form the Coordination Structural Integrity Suite of the protocol's normative architecture.

## The foundational commitments

The Coordination Structural Integrity Suite rests on two foundational commitments held together: precision and non-harming. Precision without non-harming becomes a control instrument: legibility in service of power rather than protection. Non-harming without precision becomes an attack surface: the good faith and informal trust that sufficiently adversarial actors exploit most reliably, operating in the spaces where formal instruments have no purchase. The fragility of those spaces is no longer a theoretical concern. It is the condition of the moment we are in.

Held together, they produce the structural conditions under which genuine presence is possible. For people who have been harmed by informality used against them, explicit structure is not a bureaucratic imposition. It is what trust requires before it can be extended again. The precision is the compassion. The suite is built on this foundation: not as a ceiling, but as what makes a ceiling possible.

## Start here: AI prompts and Claude skills

The Coordination Structural Integrity Suite covers a lot of ground. The architecture is intentionally broad because coordination failures are genuinely diverse and the suite is designed to address them structurally rather than symptomatically. That breadth can make it hard to know where to begin.

**AI prompts and Claude skills are the primary way to navigate this suite.** They are not supplemental tools; they are the designed entry point. The documentation in this repository is reference material that supports the prompts. The prompts carry everything an AI assistant needs to help you make sense of your situation and find the right instrument for it.

**Three entry paths.**

If you want the simplest start: use the **[AI prompt launcher](https://coordination-structural-integrity-suite.github.io/ai/)**. A web interface with all prompts accessible in one place: select your path, copy the prompt, and paste it into any AI assistant. No navigation of this repository required.

If you are new to the suite, want to understand whether it applies, or want to orient yourself before committing to a formal process: use the **[Explore the Coordination Structural Integrity Suite prompt](prompts/suite/suite-explore-coordination-structural-integrity-suite-0_1_0.md)**. Paste it into any AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or similar), describe your organization and situation in plain language, and it will orient you to what the suite is, identify the structural class of your situation, and route you to the right instrument, with an explanation of why. It produces an exploration findings document you can save and carry forward.

If you want to formally assess your organization's structural health across all ten standards and produce a gap map and advancement roadmap: use the **[Coordination Structural Integrity Suite Assessment](prompts/suite/suite-assessment-stage-1-orientation-0_1_0.md)**. This is a five-stage structured process. Each stage produces a downloadable output. Start with Stage 1, which orients you to the full process before any assessment begins. The assessment works best after completing the Explore prompt; it builds on the vocabulary and self-knowledge the exploration develops. The same assessment also exists as a [single resumable prompt](prompts/suite/suite-assessment-0_1_1.md): start fresh and Stage 1 begins automatically, or paste a prior session output to resume.

All prompts are in the `tensegrity-suite/prompts/` folder. The **[prompts README](prompts/prompts-README.md)** maps every prompt by type and use case, including the full Coordination Structural Integrity Suite Assessment stage sequence. For extended reasoning work with an AI assistant that already has access to your documents and tools, **Claude skills** are in the `skills/` subfolders; they encode the full reasoning frame for each document and for the suite as a whole.

If you have questions about applying the suite to your situation, want to share findings from using these instruments, or want to engage with others working with these standards: use **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/coordination-structural-integrity-suite/suite/discussions)**.

## What these standards are

Coordination systems fail in predictable ways. The failures are structural: they happen because the systems lack structural floors, minimum conditions that, when absent, make exploitation and degradation predictable rather than merely possible.

The compressive standards specify those floors. Each standard in this repository is an instrument: a standalone specification of a structural requirement with verifiable conditions. They are not prescriptive workflows, style guides, or evaluation rubrics. The compressive standards specify what must not be violated; the generative standards specify what must be structurally present for coordination capacity to develop and be sustained. Neither type specifies how to organize.

## What these standards are not

The compressive standards are not complete coordination infrastructure on their own. They close exploitation vectors and prevent specific failure modes. Structural floors alone are not enough. A coordination system also needs generative capacity: the conditions under which participants can develop shared understanding and sustain the structural floors as coordination instruments rather than compliance checklists. The three Tensegrity Generative Standards in this repository address that generative layer.

Partial adoption is legitimate. Partial adoption claimed as full conformance is not. The adoption architecture section below specifies the three adoption categories and the structural exposure disclosure requirement for systems that claim full suite designation without holding it.

These standards do not specify coordination outcomes. They specify structural conditions. What organizations do within those conditions is outside their scope.

## Who these standards are for

Every coordination system that has failed believed it was adequate before it failed. FTX had process documentation. Terra/Luna had economic theory. GravityDAO had values and processes. Every DAO that required emergency conflict transformation had a community that believed it had a community. The belief that structural failure modes do not apply to a specific system is not irrational from inside that system: it is the predictable output of the mechanisms those failure modes create. Organizations experiencing structural blindness do not experience it as blindness. They experience it as clarity.

These standards are designed primarily for organizations that do not currently believe they have a structural problem. Organizations already in crisis can use them, but the organizations most likely to benefit are the ones convinced their coordination is structurally sound.

The reason is structural. The failure modes these standards address are most dangerous in the phase before they are visible. Structural power concentrates gradually, through drift, before it becomes capture. Consent erodes through accumulated friction before it becomes coercion. Adverse signals accumulate as dismissed noise before they become the record of a foreseeable failure. None of the protective work these standards enable is available after the failure is apparent. It is only available before.

Adopting these standards is not primarily an act of self-protection. It is a structural health claim made to others: funders, coordinating parties, counterparties, and future members who need to evaluate whether your coordination infrastructure is sound. An organization at any adoption tier has publicly verifiable evidence of its structural health, not a private belief that things are fine. That distinction matters most to the people evaluating from outside, and it holds regardless of what the organization believes about its own risk profile.

The "it won't happen to us" assumption is not something these standards argue against. It is something these standards make structurally legible. An organization with adoption-tier evidence demonstrating its power distribution, adverse signal engagement, and consent architecture has answered the question from its structure rather than from its confidence.

<details>
<summary><b>Precision-First Design Standard</b>: the full architecture</summary>

Closes precision failure in two directions. A precision deficit occurs when instrument terms are under-specified: violations become undetectable and gaps remain permanently exploitable. A precision imposition occurs when an instrument is over-specified: compliance can be demonstrated while the coordination purpose remains unserved. Nine corollaries covering both failure directions. Two foundational principles: the precision-first invariant (the artifact test) and Method-Structure Congruence (the process test: the epistemic method used must match the structural character of what is being known; congruence deficits are self-concealing because the absent content leaves no gap marker). Addresses Ostrom's second design principle at the standards level.

<details>
<summary><b>Adverse-Signal Engagement Principle Core Standard</b>: the full architecture</summary>

Requires engagement with signals that contradict current models rather than suppression or reframing. Closes the gap between appearing to address problems and actually addressing them. Addresses Ostrom's design principles 5, 6, and 7 at the standards level.

<details>
<summary><b>Structural Consent Legibility Standard</b>: the full architecture</summary>

Requires that consent to participation be structurally distinguishable from consent to specific terms, outcomes, and power arrangements. Three consent features: negotiated limits, bidirectional awareness, revocability. Addresses Ostrom's first design principle at the standards level.

<summary><b>Information Asymmetry Classification Standard</b>: the full architecture</summary>

Requires classification and disclosure of the structural types of information asymmetry present in a coordination system. Six primary classes: positional, temporal, interpretive, relational, omission, complexity. Extension class framework for additional classes; Descriptive Capacity Asymmetry (differential linguistic-epistemic-ontological frameworks creating pre-interpretive perception gaps) is the first fully specified extension class.

<details>
<summary><b>Structural Power Obligation Standard</b>: the full architecture</summary>

Requires that structural power arrangements be legible and contestable by participants who hold less of it. Three dimensions: coordination, authority, specialization. The constituency definition (who holds participation rights and on what basis) is a structural condition subject to power distribution analysis; it presupposes that affected parties can participate directly. Where coordination decisions affect parties who cannot participate directly (lacking the necessary standing or not yet existing), proxy and guardian architecture names the structural form for existing non-participating parties; conditions-of-possibility guardianship names the form for parties who do not yet exist (representing structural prerequisites for future participation, not the interests of future persons). Section 4.5 adds external override capacity: seven classes of structural condition through which external actors can supersede internal coordination outcomes regardless of the coordination process (Financial, Military/coercive, Regulatory, Platform, Epistemic, Normative, Relational dependency). Adopting systems must identify which classes are active and produce structural exposure disclosures for each. Addresses Ostrom's design principles 1, 3, and 8 at the standards level; cross-boundary detection architecture for DP8 remains an open design question; relational dependency detection architecture (Class 7) is an open design question addressed in Section 11.6.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Regenerative Obligation Standard</b>: the full architecture</summary>

Requires that extraction of contributor capacity (labor, attention, knowledge, legitimacy) be matched by regenerative return satisfying three conditions simultaneously: non-fungibility (return must operate in the register of the harm, not a substitute register chosen by the extracting party), proximity (return must flow through a traceable causal chain to the parties who bear the harm, verified against a harm-bearing affiliation registry), and embeddedness (return must operate within the relational structure generated by the extraction obligation, not severed by market substitution or disconnected pooling). Scope: this standard applies to internal extraction and return mechanics, not to what the organization funds or produces externally; a system funding externally regenerative projects while failing the validity conditions for its own contributors' extraction is not conformant. Three categorical disqualifiers for the proximity condition: additionality logic (routes payment to parties who threatened harm, not parties who bore it); Social Return on Investment (SROI) aggregation (permits harm to one stakeholder group to be offset by benefit to another); and the temporal deferral trap (architecture that resolves the organization's accounting through declaration of intent rather than verifiable proximate return delivery; the test is whether registered harm-bearing parties can verify receipt, not merely that intent was declared). Organizations adopting the standard must declare a stance (non-extractive, or more regenerative than extractive) and register harm-bearing affiliations. The standard addresses the Hidden Factory failure mode: when an organization reaches Stage D and continues extracting the output of a contributor's hidden factory without recognition or integration, that is the extraction this floor exists to prevent. The visibility condition requires that extraction be registerable, not only recorded. Two suppression types are structurally distinct: Step 01-formation (distorted normal baseline from growing up inside extraction) and identity fusion (the Stage D-E mechanism where the contributor's sense of worth has become entangled with absorbing the load, making claim-raising require disidentification from a load-bearing role). Organizations cannot rely on voluntary claim-raising when either suppression type is present.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Coordination Scaling Standard</b>: the full architecture</summary>

Specifies the structural conditions that coordination units must install at each Dunbar-scale threshold before crossing it. Six nested Radii define coordination segments (Radius 5, 15, 50, 150 are normative; Radius 500 and 1500 are provisional) at which specific coordination functions change. At each threshold, minimum conditions specify the structural requirements for coordination at that Radius to be possible; maximum conditions specify the structural specification whose absence enables capture at that Radius. All minimum conditions for all crossed thresholds apply simultaneously: partial installation across thresholds is not conformance. The standard is precondition compressive: operating below minimum conditions for the current effective Radius means the coordination functions the other compressive standards protect have already broken at the threshold. Effective Radius is determined by the aggregate of member count, interaction frequency and quality, shared context depth, and communication medium mix, not by headcount alone. The standard distinguishes nominal Effective Radius (capacity with full membership present) from robust Effective Radius (capacity under worst-case single departure); a gap between the two is a maximum conditions concern. The founding window (the period before each threshold crossing during which minimum conditions for the next Radius can be installed most effectively) closes at the crossing; installing minimum conditions during the crisis that their absence creates produces poorly designed specifications.

<details>
<summary><b>Sensemaking Standard</b>: the full architecture</summary>

Specifies what sensemaking must structurally provide for coordination to remain self-correcting. Five structural invariants: disruption-occasioned, particular-to-general relating, action-entangled, sufficiency-oriented, temporally structured. Three operational scales: intra-personal, inter-personal, witness-reception. The particular-to-general relating invariant names three violation signatures: assertion (conclusion without traceable cues), cataloging (cues accumulated without a general frame emerging), and personal-framing misapplication (a general frame applied that misidentifies the register of causation, assigning personal causes to a structural mechanism or vice versa, without examining whether the frame fits the cues). The standard specifies structural conditions; it does not prescribe method.

<details>
<summary><b>Four Batteries Capacity Standard</b>: the full architecture</summary>

Specifies the structural conditions under which four orthogonal capacity dimensions (Personal, Relational, Contribution, Mission) enable coordination surplus rather than merely preventing failure. Each battery operates across two independent dimensions: charge (cyclical, maintainable) and developmental state (permanent until transformed through integration events). Specifies depletion archetypes, generative archetypes, and structural connections to the seven Tensegrity Compressive Standards. The seventh connection (Contribution Battery and Regenerative Obligation Standard) names the Hidden Factory Stage D self-reinforcing detection gap: the Regenerative Obligation Standard floor violation depletes the claiming capacity needed to surface it, and voluntary claim-raising cannot break the loop without battery state data showing the co-occurrence pattern.

<details>
<summary><b>Conflict Transformation Standard</b>: the full architecture</summary>

Specifies the structural conditions under which a coordination system develops and sustains conflict transformation capacity. Five structural invariants: conflict legibility, graduated engagement architecture, proactive disposition enablement, transformation capacity provision, recognition as coordination work. Three operational scales: intra-organizational, inter-organizational, protocol-level. Addresses Ostrom's design principles 4, 5, and 6 at the standards level. Primary empirical grounding: GravityDAO operated for seven years, was universally recognized as necessary, and failed entirely because no existing coordination infrastructure provided a mechanism to recognize conflict transformation as coordination work. The standard addresses that structural gap directly.

## Suite-level documents

Five documents support the standards as a system rather than as individual instruments.

**Tensegrity Architecture** describes the two-layer structural logic of the suite: how the seven Tensegrity Compressive Standards and three Tensegrity Generative Standards work together, why both layers are required, and the failure modes each addresses. Start here if you want to understand the architecture before reading individual standards.

**Suite Structural Patterns Primer** describes recurring structural patterns across the standards, common adoption sequences, and cross-cutting design principles.

**Suite Integration Guide** describes how the ten standards relate to each other structurally: which standards depend on which for reliable detection, what the detection reliability dependencies mean for audit confidence, five adoption entry points organized by organizational pain, and how to navigate the suite as a system rather than a collection of independent instruments.

**Suite Deployment Contexts** is the practice-level companion for standards selection. It organizes the suite by the purposes you are trying to achieve rather than by structural layer: which standards to deploy together for adverse signal surfacing, coordination disputes, coordination capture, invisible work and contributor burnout, and decision-making without adequate information. Includes calibration guidance for tensegrity type, battery state, and substrate profile.

**Conflict Transformation Preconditions Specification** is a downstream operational specification for the Conflict Transformation Standard. It translates the standard's five structural invariants into six precondition domains that practitioners assess before deploying any specific conflict transformation process: container design, scale proportion, process mode selection, traversal mode selection, threshold management, and the continuous consent loop.

**Frame Language Foundational Vocabulary Specification** (added in Suite 3.0, CC BY 4.0) is the vocabulary specification for the diagnostic language used across the Suite and in grant obligation contexts. It documents the conceptual tools developed over 17 iterative patch versions to describe the distinction between structural grounding and aspiration in coordination systems. Frame Language is not a normative standard and does not add requirements to the ten compressive and generative standards; it names the vocabulary those standards assume when diagnosing failure modes. It is published as a Suite document at version 1.0.0 rather than a patch version because the vocabulary it documents is conceptually mature.

**CROSS: Common Reporting Outcome Standards Schema** is an independent standard co-released alongside Suite 3.0 under CC0. CROSS specifies what funded interventions are obligated to produce. It is not a Suite document and does not carry the CC BY 4.0 license; it maintains independent publication status so any grants ecosystem can adopt it without adopting the Suite. It is covered in this README because it was developed in parallel with the Suite and shares structural grounding with the Precision-First Design Standard, Adverse-Signal Engagement Principle Core Standard, Information Asymmetry Classification Standard, and Regenerative Obligation Standard, from which it inherits requirements by reference.

---

## How the standards work together

The ten standards are each independently adoptable. But the suite works as a whole, and some standards have structural reliability dependencies that matter for how you use them.

### Detection reliability dependencies

Some compressive standards' detection results are unreliable when certain generative conditions are absent. This is not a flaw in the compressive standards. It is a structural property of how detection works: a surface that depends on human signal-surfacing will produce false negatives when the conditions for surfacing are absent.

**Adverse-Signal Engagement Principle Core Standard depends on Relational Battery.** If the Relational Battery is depleted, participants will not surface adverse signals even when explicitly invited to do so, because the relational context makes surfacing feel unsafe or pointless. An audit showing no adverse signals in a relational-battery-depleted organization is a false negative. The detection surface appears compliant while signals are being suppressed. Joint adoption of the Adverse-Signal Engagement Principle Core Standard and Four Batteries Capacity Standard is required for adverse signal audit results to be trustworthy.

**Structural Consent Legibility Standard depends on Relational Battery.** Consent that is structurally present but relational-battery-depleted is hollow: participants agree because the relational context makes refusal feel unsafe, not because they freely consent. Structural consent detection appears satisfied while the underlying relational condition means consent is structural theater rather than genuine authorization.

**Structural Power Obligation Standard (coordination dimension) depends on Sensemaking Standard.** Interpretive power concentration is the primary accumulation vector in the coordination dimension, and it is only detectable when meaning-making processes are observable and their authority is legible. If sensemaking is non-functional, the coordination dimension of structural power distribution detection is blind to the most consequential form of power accumulation.

**Information Asymmetry Classification Standard (omission class) depends on Sensemaking Standard and Contribution Battery.** Omission asymmetry, what is deliberately never said, is only detectable when sensemaking processes surface what participants are not naming. Contribution Battery depletion drives work outside the visible record, which constitutes omission asymmetry that standard detection will not find because the activity generating it is invisible to the coordination record.

### Joint adoption starting points

If you are deciding where to begin, map your primary pain to the standards most likely to address it.

**Signals are being suppressed or dismissed.** Start with the Adverse-Signal Engagement Principle Core Standard and Four Batteries Capacity Standard together. Suppressed signals are both a structural engagement failure and a Relational Battery failure. Instrumenting only the Adverse-Signal Engagement Principle Core Standard will show false compliance. Instrumenting only Four Batteries will show the depletion without naming the structural obligation to engage despite it.

**Coordination capture or authority concentration.** Start with the Structural Power Obligation Standard and Structural Consent Legibility Standard together. These address the two primary mechanisms of capture: authority accumulation across the three power dimensions, and consent that is formally present but structurally hollow.

**Invisible work and contributor burnout.** Start with the Four Batteries Capacity Standard and Regenerative Obligation Standard together. The Hidden Factory dynamic is the Four Batteries presentation; the extraction floor is what the Regenerative Obligation Standard closes.

**Decisions made without adequate information.** Start with the Information Asymmetry Classification Standard and Sensemaking Standard together. The taxonomy names the structural gaps; the sensemaking conditions determine whether those gaps can be surfaced and processed by the people who bear them.

**Conflict destroying organizational capacity.** Start with the Conflict Transformation Standard and Adverse-Signal Engagement Principle Core Standard together. Conflict transformation provides the structural container; the Adverse-Signal Engagement Principle ensures that what emerges from conflict is processed rather than suppressed or routed directly to adversarial adjudication.

## Adoption architecture

Each standard in this repository carries a five-tier adoption framework that describes the organization's conformance level for the requirement the standard specifies. The tiers are consistent in structure across all ten standards, though the specific operational requirements differ per standard.

**Tier 1, Assessed.** The organization has mapped its documents or operations against the standard. A deficit inventory exists. No process changes are required at this tier. No conformance claim is made.

**Tier 2, Operational.** The organization has defined processes for identifying and tracking deficits. Deficits are recorded durably with document, location, deficit type, and date. The record is maintained as changes occur.

**Tier 3, Instrumented.** The organization applies the standard at design time. No element in scope is considered complete until the standard's requirements are met. The organization can report its current conformance state without a dedicated review cycle.

**Tier 4, Loop-Closed.** Includes all Tier 3 requirements plus closed coordination loop architecture. Detected deficits produce mandatory coordination responses, and the absence of a response is itself structurally visible.

**Tier 5, Auditable.** Includes all Tier 4 requirements plus independent auditability. The deficit record must be verifiable by an independent auditor for both presence (each recorded deficit was identified) and completeness (all identified deficits are in the record).

Tiers 1 through 3 are normatively specified across all seven Tensegrity Compressive Standards. Tiers 4 and 5 are specified in architecture; normative completion is pending pilot data.

## Adoption claims

Three adoption categories govern how adoption is described. They are mutually exclusive and exhaustive: any system that has adopted one or more standards falls into exactly one category at any given time.

**Adoption level.** A system that has adopted one or more standards at any tier has an adoption level. Adoption level is a developmental description, not a conformance claim. It is expressed per standard: "this system has adopted the Adverse Signal Engagement Principle Core Standard at Tier 2 (Operational)." No general conformance claim follows from an adoption level. An adoption level is not a credential; it describes where a system is in its developmental trajectory.

**Full Tensegrity Compressive Standards designation.** A system that has adopted all seven Tensegrity Compressive Standards at Tier 4 (Loop-Closed) or above holds the full Tensegrity Compressive Standards designation. This is the only category that carries a conformance claim. The designation is all-or-nothing: Tier 4 across five standards and Tier 3 on the sixth does not satisfy it. The designation is descriptive, not a credential: it names an observable structural state.

**Structural exposure disclosure.** A system that claims full suite designation without holding it must produce a structural exposure disclosure in place of a conformance claim. A substantive disclosure contains four elements: it names each absent or sub-Tier-4 standard by its full canonical name; it describes in plain language the specific failure mode class that standard addresses and what becomes structurally undetectable in its absence; it states a self-assessed exposure level (low, medium, or high) with a rationale an independent reader can evaluate; and it names any compensating controls with their mechanism and adequacy basis. Where no compensating controls exist, the disclosure says so explicitly.

A disclosure that names absent standards without the failure mode description, exposure assessment, and compensating control inventory is form-compliant but not substantive. Form-compliant disclosures that omit the required content are precision deficits under the Precision-First Design Standard and are subject to the same adverse signal processing as any other precision failure.

Partial adoption is legitimate developmental progress. Partial adoption claimed as full conformance is not. The structural exposure disclosure is the mechanism that keeps that distinction legible to outside observers.

## Framework-application documents

The ten standards specify structural conditions. They define what must be present or absent for a coordination system to meet a structural requirement. They do not specify how to make operational decisions in specific domains.

Framework-application documents are a companion class that works differently. They take a specific decision domain (one where the foundational frameworks produce concrete operational guidance) and specify how to work through that domain systematically. They do not carry conformance tiers and cannot be adopted or failed. They are operational tools: sequences, checks, and structural design guidance for a defined problem class.

The distinction matters because it changes how you use them. A standard tells you whether your system has a structural floor. A framework-application document walks you through a decision. You can use a framework-application document without adopting its related standard, though the reasoning behind it becomes clearer if you have.

### Six-V Trust Framework

**What it addresses:** the trust-extension decision. How do you extend trust and access to a counterparty (individual, firm, or protocol) in a way that prevents social signals from substituting for structural evidence?

**Why this decision domain needs its own document:** trust-extension failures are among the most consistently documented failure modes in decentralized coordination. The failure is not that structural checks do not exist; it is that they are suppressed before they run. The suppression mechanism is social: normality reads as safety, relational value colonizes the stakes assessment, and by the time anyone thinks to run a structural check, running it feels like betrayal. A standard can specify the floor. An application guide can walk you through the sequence that prevents suppression from closing the trap.

**The framework:** six social and structural factors in a specific sequence (Visible, Vanilla, Vulnerable, Value, Verify, Validate) with named failure modes at each step and a two-track design for separating relational warmth from credentialing decisions.

## Relationship to the Proof of Coordination protocol

<p align="center">

</p>

These standards are the normative foundation for the Proof of Coordination protocol, which builds measurement infrastructure for coordination capacity. The standards can be adopted independently of the full protocol. The protocol depends on them structurally.

Full protocol documentation will be linked here as it is released.

## Changelog

2026-04-17: Suite expanded from nine standards to ten. Coordination Scaling Standard added as the seventh Tensegrity Compressive Standard. All suite-level counts updated (nine → ten, six compressive → seven compressive). Coordination Scaling Standard description added to the compressive standards section. Full Tensegrity Compressive Standards designation threshold updated to seven. Suite Integration Guide and detection reliability count updated.

2026-04-15: Tier 4 renamed from "Accountable" to "Loop-Closed" in the adoption architecture section, matching the Frame Language pass naming convention applied in the Structural Power Obligation Standard (v0.1.22) and Adverse Signal Engagement Principle Core Standard (v0.7.8). Vocabulary updated to "closed coordination loop architecture," "mandatory coordination responses," and "Tier 4 (Loop-Closed) or above" throughout.

2026-04-11: AI prompt launcher added as first entry path in "Start here" section. "Two entry paths" updated to "Three entry paths" with the launcher (https://coordination-structural-integrity-suite.github.io/ai/) listed first as the simplest no-navigation-required option. Foundational commitments section added between opening paragraphs and "Start here." Names precision and non-harming as constitutively paired axiomatic commitments: the failure modes of each in isolation, what they produce together, and the generative capacity that becomes possible above the structural floor they establish together.

2026-04-06: Suite 2.5 publication pass (continued). AI prompts and Claude skills established as primary orientation method. "Start here" section added to README: triage prompt and architecture orientation prompt called out as front-door entry points. Repository structure updated to reflect full prompt and skills architecture. Six new Claude skills added: coordination-suite-triage, tensegrity-architecture, structural-patterns-primer, integration-guide, deployment-contexts, conflict-transformation-preconditions. Six new prompts added: suite triage (Where Do I Start?), tensegrity-architecture orientation, structural-patterns-primer recognition, integration-guide adoption-sequencing, deployment-contexts combination-selection, conflict-transformation-preconditions readiness. New prompt subfolders created for all six. prompts-README restructured with triage as front-door entry and four-format taxonomy.

2026-05-09: Regenerative Obligation Standard entry updated with two additions: (1) scope clarification: standard applies to internal extraction and return mechanics, not to external funding destinations; (2) temporal deferral trap added as third categorical proximity disqualifier alongside additionality and SROI; the test is verifiable receipt by registered harm-bearing parties, not declared intent. Suite skill (→ v0.1.2), compressive audit (→ v0.1.2), Stage 3 self-assessment (→ v0.1.1), ROS skill (→ v0.1.3), ROS audit prompt (→ v0.1.3), and Regenerative Obligation Standard (→ v0.1.7) all updated in the same pass.

2026-04-06: Suite 2.5 publication pass. Plain-language preambles added to all nine standards: each standard now opens with two paragraphs grounding it in the lived experience of the coordination failure it addresses, followed by a one-sentence navigation pointer to the Suite Integration Guide and Suite Deployment Contexts. Suite-level documents section added to README: Tensegrity Architecture, Suite Structural Patterns Primer, Suite Integration Guide, Suite Deployment Contexts, Conflict Transformation Preconditions Specification. Conflict Transformation Preconditions Specification (v0.1.0) created: six precondition domains for process deployment, previously referenced in the Conflict Transformation Standard as a document that did not exist. Tensegrity Architecture updated to v0.1.1: nine-standard counts throughout, Regenerative Obligation Standard paragraph added. Two stale "five Tensegrity Compressive Standards" references in this README corrected to six.

2026-04-06: Added "How the standards work together" section with two subsections: detection reliability dependencies (naming the generative standard conditions required for each compressive standard's detection to be trustworthy) and joint adoption starting points (mapping common pain presentations to standard combinations). Addresses the practitioner gap where independent adoptability of each standard obscures structural interdependencies that affect audit reliability.

2026-04-06: Framework-application document class introduced. Six-V Trust Framework promoted from bucket to framework ring as first instance. Framework-application documents section added to README explaining the class, its relationship to standards, and the Six-V document specifically. Claude skill (claude-skill-six-v-0_1_0.md) and application guide prompt (six-v-application-guide-0_1_0.md) added. Prompts-README updated with Six-V section.

2026-04-06: Suite expanded from eight standards to nine. Regenerative Obligation Standard added as the sixth Tensegrity Compressive Standard. Four Batteries Capacity Standard extended with Section 8 (Scope and Delegation Conditions): four structural conditions for scope recognition, three organizational-level failure signatures (Recruitment Avoidance Hidden Factory, Positional Capture, Mutual Non-Aggression Equilibrium), satisfaction signature, developmental practice requirement, and tiered adoption. Non-harming opening formula added to all nine standards: each standard now opens with a plain-language statement of the specific harms the lack of its domain produces and names its structural answer. Suite skill, README, and per-standard skill files updated. Sufficiency Standard (v0.1.0) dissolved and archived: its content absorbed into Four Batteries Section 8. SVG diagrams updated: standards-frameworks-context-0_1_2.svg and standards-ostrom-mapping-0_1_2.svg now reflect the nine-standard suite architecture with Regenerative Obligation Standard as the sixth compressive standard. framework-relationships-0_1_0.svg covers the five foundational frameworks (not the standards enumeration) and does not require updating.

2026-04-02: SVG diagrams overhauled for contrast and legibility. All three diagrams updated: low-contrast text colors replaced with bright yellow (warm sections), bright sky blue (cool sections), and near-white (body text). Standard name headings in compressive section given teal accent for visual hierarchy. Ostrom diagram renamed "Standards Implementation" throughout for general-audience clarity.

2026-03-31: Added two visualizations: (1) Five Frameworks, One Phenomenon, showing the structural logic of the suite and its relationship to the framework layer; (2) Ostrom's Eight Design Principles mapped to corpus operationalization. Both SVGs in images/ subfolder.

2026-03-28: Repository restructured into nested suite/compressive/ and suite/generative/ folders. Subfolder READMEs added for suite/, compressive/, and generative/. Title updated to full suite name. Generative standards heading corrected to include full layer name. Licensing section path pattern generalized.

2026-03-28: Added "Adoption architecture" section (five-tier framework, tier definitions) and "Adoption claims" section (three adoption categories: adoption level, full Tensegrity Compressive Standards designation, structural exposure disclosure). Updated "What these standards are not" partial adoption sentence to forward-reference the new adoption architecture section rather than giving a weaker standalone summary.
