# Prompts

Paste-and-go prompts for using the Coordination Structural Integrity Suite with any AI assistant.

Copy the full contents of any prompt file, paste it into any AI chat (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or similar), and describe your situation or attach the document you want assessed. No prior knowledge of the suite is required. The prompts carry everything the AI needs.

**If you are new to the suite and do not know where to start, use the [Where Do I Start? triage prompt](suite/suite-triage-where-do-i-start-0_1_1.md) first.** It assesses your situation and routes you to the right instrument, with an explanation of why.

**Two entry paths.** This prompt system has two tracks. Start with the Explore prompt if you are new to the suite, want to understand whether it applies, or want to orient yourself before committing to a formal process. Start with the Coordination Structural Integrity Suite Assessment if you want to formally assess your organization's structural health across all ten standards and produce a concrete gap map and advancement roadmap. The assessment process works best after the exploration; it builds on the vocabulary and structural self-knowledge the exploration develops.

Five prompt formats are used across this repository:

**Exploration format**: orients you to the suite and your structural situation, routes you to the right instrument, and produces a findings document you can save and carry forward. Used for the Explore prompt.

**Assessment format**: guides you through a structured five-stage process: foundation check, self-assessment across all ten standards, gap mapping, and advancement planning. Multi-session. Produces a downloadable output at each stage. Used for the Coordination Structural Integrity Suite Assessment.

**Audit format** (compressive standards): identifies where a document or system fails to meet a structural requirement. Output is a failure map organized by criterion, most consequential deficits first. Used for the seven Tensegrity Compressive Standards.

**Capacity development format** (generative standards): identifies whether the structural conditions enabling a capacity are present and what the growth edges are. Output is a presence map with cultivation guidance. Used for the three Tensegrity Generative Standards.

**Application guide format** (framework-application documents and suite documents): walks through a framework or document's logic against a specific situation the user brings. No conformance score. Output is a structural reading of your case or a routing recommendation. Used for framework-application documents (Six-V Trust Framework), suite documents (Tensegrity Architecture, Structural Patterns Primer, Suite Integration Guide, Suite Deployment Contexts), and pre-deployment assessments (Conflict Transformation Preconditions Specification).

## Where Do I Start?

Two entry points. Choose based on where you are.

| Prompt | Use it when |
|---|---|
| [Explore the Coordination Structural Integrity Suite](suite/suite-explore-coordination-structural-integrity-suite-0_1_0.md) | You are new to the suite, unsure whether it applies, or want to understand your structural situation before committing to a formal process. Produces an exploration findings document you can carry into the assessment process. |
| [Coordination Structural Integrity Suite Assessment - Stage 1](suite/suite-assessment-stage-1-orientation-0_1_0.md) | You want to formally assess your organization's structural health across all ten standards. Five-stage process. Best after completing the Explore prompt. |

The legacy triage prompt ([Where Do I Start?](suite/suite-triage-where-do-i-start-0_1_1.md)) is still available for direct routing to individual instruments when you already know which standard or prompt you need.

The full assessment also exists as a [single resumable prompt](suite/suite-assessment-0_1_1.md): start fresh and Stage 1 begins automatically, or paste a prior session output to resume where you left off.

## Coordination Structural Integrity Suite Assessment

A five-stage structured process for assessing your organization's structural health across all ten standards. Each stage produces a downloadable output. Stages can be completed in separate sessions; bring your prior stage output to each new session.

| Stage | Prompt | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Stage 0 | [Context Accumulation](suite/suite-assessment-stage-0-context-accumulation-0_3_0.md) | Establishes what kind of arrangement is being assessed, what the historical and structural record says about that kind of thing, and who outside the arrangement's defined party list is affected. Classifies the institutional form, surfaces the compressive and generative precondition profiles, maps the active failure modes (FM1-FM15), assesses the tensegrity configuration, and states the suite's standing limitation. This stage is not optional; without it, the assessment cannot catch correctness-of-design failures, external validity failures, or reference class failures. Output: context summary. |
| Stage 1 | [Process Orientation](suite/suite-assessment-stage-1-orientation-0_1_0.md) | Orients you to the full process, establishes what you are hoping to understand, presents the data consent statement. Output: process summary. |
| Stage 2 | [Structural Foundation Check](suite/suite-assessment-stage-2-foundation-check-0_1_0.md) | Assesses which of the six coordination commons components are present, partial, or absent in your actual practice. Output: commons components inventory. |
| Stage 3 | [Standards Self-Assessment](suite/suite-assessment-stage-3-self-assessment-0_1_2.md) | For each of the ten standards, assesses where your organization currently stands against what the standard requires. Multi-session. Output: standards self-assessment with structured finding per standard. |
| Stage 4 | [Gap Map and Priorities](suite/suite-assessment-stage-4-gap-map-0_1_0.md) | Synthesizes your Stage 2 and Stage 3 findings into your three most structurally significant gaps, with gap type and what addressing each would look like. Output: gap map. |
| Stage 5 | [External Frame Assessment](suite/suite-assessment-stage-5-external-frame-0_1_0.md) | Assesses the arrangement from outside its own logic across four dimensions: ecological fit (ecosystem dependencies and externalities), counterfactual (better than absence or alternatives?), legitimacy class (basis and soundness of authority claim), and value instantiation (what values the incentive structure actually produces). Requires Stage 0 context summary and Stage 4 gap map as inputs. Output: external frame assessment with synthesis. |
| Stage 6 | [Advancement and Future Framing](suite/suite-assessment-stage-5-advancement-0_1_0.md) | Consolidates findings from all five prior stages, opens with the most important external frame finding, establishes concrete next steps for each priority gap, frames a six-month re-assessment. Output: advancement summary. |

## Frame Language

Frame Language is a diagnostic method for auditing governance documents, charters, constitutions, proposal templates, and dispute resolution processes for vocabulary that imports Frame 1 structural assumptions. Frame 1 vocabulary names organizational conditions in terms of authority, accumulation, and hierarchical accountability. It constructs the system into a specific structural form before a single rule is written. The audit identifies which terms are doing that work, what structural assumption each carries, what more specified Frame 2 vocabulary would name instead, and what structural possibilities the Frame 1 vocabulary forecloses.

| Prompt | Use it on |
|---|---|
| [Frame Language Vocabulary Audit](frame-language/frame-language-vocabulary-audit-0_1_0.md) | Any governance document, charter, constitution, proposal template, dispute resolution process, or regenerative/regen community document (includes a regen-specific audit, Regen Reality Check, for documents making regenerative claims) |

---

## Framework-Application Document Prompts

Framework-application documents are operational tools that apply the foundational frameworks to specific decision domains. Their prompts walk through a sequence against a specific case rather than checking conformance.

### Six-V Trust Framework

| Prompt | Use it on |
|---|---|
| [Application Guide](six-v/six-v-application-guide-0_1_0.md) | A specific relationship advancing in access or trust, a credentialing process you are designing, or a past trust-extension failure you are analyzing |
